# Aria Compiler v0.0.17 - Archived Source Code

**Archive Date:** December 14, 2025
**Reason:** Complete restart with systematic implementation plan
**Status:** This code reached modular architecture but needs fresh start with research-driven approach

## What This Archive Contains

All source code from v0.0.17 including:
- Complete modular backend (ExprCodeGen, LambdaCodeGen, StmtCodeGen, etc.)
- Frontend (lexer, parser, type checker, borrow checker)
- Runtime (GC, allocators, I/O)
- All includes and headers

## Why Archive?

Starting fresh with:
1. Complete research documentation (31 research reports)
2. Systematic implementation plan
3. Step-by-step TODO with research references
4. Proper development workflow (dev → main only when tested)

## Research Foundation

All 31 research reports completed covering:
- Type system (integers, floats, composites, generics)
- Control flow (loops, conditionals, control transfer)
- Memory management (borrow checker, GC, wild/wildx)
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, special)
- Standard library foundations
- Async/await, modules, compile-time computation

## Next Steps

Build compiler systematically from research, one verified step at a time.
