ARIA PARSER BUG: Assignment Statements After First Statement in Function Body
===============================================================================

DISCOVERED: 2025-01-XX during ARA implementation
SEVERITY: CRITICAL - Blocks most real-world programming
STATUS: UNFIXED

SYMPTOMS:
---------
Parse Error: "Expected token type 181 (RBRACE) but got 144 (ASSIGN)"
Occurs when trying to use assignment statements after the first statement in a function body.

REPRODUCTION:
-------------
```aria
func:test = int64() {
    int64:x = 10;    // ✅ WORKS - first statement (declaration)
    x = 20;          // ❌ FAILS - assignment after first statement
    pass(x);
};
```

Error: "Parse Error: Expected token type 181 but got 144 at line 4, col 7"

RELATED BUGS:
-------------
- Assignments inside if blocks also fail (see if_statement_assignment_bug.txt)
- Pattern: Parser expects RBRACE when it sees ASSIGN in certain contexts

WHAT WORKS:
-----------
✅ Variable declarations: `int64:x = 10;`
✅ Function calls: `print("hello");`
✅ Multiple function calls in sequence
✅ pass() and fail() statements

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
------------------
❌ Reassignment: `x = 20;`
❌ Compound assignment: `x += 5;`
❌ Pointer dereferencing assignment: `@ptr = value;`
❌ Any assignment after first statement in function

TOKEN IDS:
----------
181 = TOKEN_RBRACE (right brace })
144 = TOKEN_ASSIGN (assignment operator =)

IMPACT:
-------
- Cannot modify variables after initialization
- Cannot implement loops with counters
- Cannot update pointers after dereference writes
- Blocks ARA (runtime assembler) implementation
- Blocks most non-trivial functions

TEST CASES:
-----------
test_assign_func.aria - Simple reassignment (FAILS)
test_multi_stmt.aria - Multiple function calls (WORKS)
test_if_or_assign.aria - Assignment in if block (FAILS)
test_if_or.aria - Regular assignment in if block (FAILS)

PARSER LOCATION:
----------------
Likely in parseStmt() or parseBlockOrStatement() function
The parser seems to expect function body to end after first statement
when the next token is TOKEN_ASSIGN.

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------
The recent fix for user-defined types added identifier lookahead:

```cpp
if (current.type == TOKEN_IDENTIFIER) {
    Token saved = current;
    advance();
    
    if (current.type == TOKEN_COLON) {
        // Variable declaration
    } else {
        // Expression statement
    }
}
```

Problem: After first statement, parser might not be looping back to
parse more statements, OR the identifier lookahead is consuming
tokens incorrectly for subsequent statements.

WORKAROUNDS:
------------
None found. Cannot implement functions that modify variables.

PRIORITY:
---------
HIGHEST - This is a fundamental language capability
