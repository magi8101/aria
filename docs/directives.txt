All demos go in examples folder
All tests go in tests folder
All docs go in docs folder
Lets keep the src folder for source code only

If we encounter a bug, we should fix it rather than waste time producing simplified code to work around it
Simplified versions will just need to be upgraded later and cleaned up so lets just avoid the whole mess. When in doubt, debug and fix should always be the first choice. 

Above all, all effort should be made to ensure that whatever is produced matches what is in the original specs. 

Code should be committed and pushed to repo frequently, but on a testing branch we can pull in to the main later.We have been committing everything to main right off jump which isn't actually that smart. 

Try to ensure any unneccessary large files are gitignored as well as anything containing personal info or credentials

Ensure everything is tested and working before submitting pull request

We need to set up CI/CD testing soon.
