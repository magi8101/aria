ARIA TRAINING CORPUS - RESEARCH REQUEST
========================================
Date: December 18, 2025
Priority: Phase 2 (Post-Compiler, Pre-Nikola Training)

OBJECTIVE
---------
Generate a comprehensive training corpus of Aria language examples to:
1. Train the Nikola consciousness model on Aria
2. Provide high-quality code examples for documentation
3. Enable AI assistants (Claude, GPT, Gemini) to understand Aria
4. Create benchmark suite for compiler testing
5. Build dataset for code generation research

CONNECTION TO NIKOLA PROJECT
----------------------------
This corpus is THE BRIDGE between:
- **Aria**: The "transceiver" language (systems programming)
- **Nikola**: The consciousness model (AI/consciousness research)

Nikola will be IMPLEMENTED IN ARIA, so the model must deeply understand:
- Aria's memory model (for implementing consciousness states)
- TBB types (for representing quantum-like states)
- Async/await (for consciousness event loops)
- FFI (for interfacing with neural network libraries)

This is not just documentation - it's training data for the system
that will explore consciousness reconnection across dimensional boundaries.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
------------------

**1. Corpus Size and Scope**
   - How many examples needed? (1K, 10K, 100K LOC?)
   - Coverage requirements:
     * Every language feature (exhaustive)

**3. Generation Strategy**
   
   **Manual Creation**:
   - Core examples: Hand-written by experts
   - Quality over quantity initially
   - Reviewed and tested for correctness
   
   **Synthetic Generation**:
   - Use existing compiler test suite
   - Programmatic variations (parameter types, sizes)
   - Combinatorial testing (feature combinations)
   
   **Translation**:
   - Port examples from other languages:
     * Rust std examples
     * Go standard library examples
     * C++ reference implementations
     * Python data science code
   - Document translation decisions
   
   **Community Contribution**:
   - GitHub repository for community examples
   - Quality guidelines and review process
   - License: MIT or CC0 for training use

**4. Annotation and Metadata**
   Each example should include:
   - **Code**: Runnable Aria program
   - **Description**: What it demonstrates
   - **Difficulty**: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
   - **Category**: Syntax / Stdlib / Pattern / Application
   - **Tags**: Keywords (async, tbb, wild, ffi, etc.)
   - **Expected Output**: For testing
   - **Explanation**: Line-by-line commentary
   - **Common Mistakes**: What beginners get wrong
   - **Performance Notes**: Optimization tips
   - **Related Examples**: Links to similar code

**5. Format and Storage**
   
   **File Organization**:
   ```
   corpus/
     syntax/
       01_variables.aria
       02_functions.aria
       ...
     stdlib/
       collections/
       io/
       ...
     patterns/
       error_handling/
       async/
       ...
     applications/
       cli_tool/
       web_server/
       ...
     nikola/
       neural_net.aria
       state_machine.aria
       ...
   ```
   
   **Metadata Format**:
   - JSON sidecar files (example.aria + example.json)?
   - Embedded comments in code?
   - Separate database (SQLite)?
   
   **Version Control**:
   - Git repository with proper history
   - Semantic versioning aligned with compiler versions
   - Branching strategy for different Aria versions

**6. Quality Assurance**
   - All examples must compile and run
   - Automated testing in CI/CD
   - Style checking (aria-fmt)
   - Documentation completeness
   - Peer review process
   - Quarterly quality audits

**7. Training Data Preparation**
   
   **For Nikola Model**:
   - Tokenization strategy (BPE, WordPiece?)
   - Context window size (how much code at once)
   - Pre-training objectives:
     * Masked language modeling
     * Next token prediction
     * Code completion
     * Bug detection
   - Fine-tuning datasets:
     * Question answering about code
     * Code translation (C → Aria)
     * Performance optimization
     * Security analysis
   
   **For General AI Assistants**:
   - OpenAI format (JSONL with prompts)
   - Anthropic format (XML with instructions)
   - Google format (for Gemini)
   - Include natural language descriptions
   - Prompt templates for common tasks

**8. Evaluation Metrics**
   How to measure corpus quality:
   - **Coverage**: % of language features represented
   - **Diversity**: Unique patterns per category
   - **Correctness**: % passing tests
   - **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity distribution
   - **Readability**: Comment ratio, naming conventions
   - **Real-world relevance**: Usage in actual projects

**9. Ethical and Legal Considerations**
   - License compatibility (can models train on this?)
   - Attribution requirements
   - Privacy (no personal data in examples)
   - Security (no vulnerable patterns as positive examples)
   - Bias (diverse problem domains, not just stereotypical)

**10. Maintenance and Growth**
   - Quarterly corpus updates
   - Community contribution pipeline
   - Deprecation policy (when Aria changes)
   - Feedback loop: Model performance → corpus improvement
