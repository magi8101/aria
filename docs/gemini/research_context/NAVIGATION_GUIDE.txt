ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FILES
=====================================

aria_specs.txt - ALWAYS UPLOAD THIS
  Location: /home/randy/._____RANDY_____/REPOS/aria/docs/info/aria_specs.txt
  Size: ~20KB
  Contains: Complete language specification

Existing Research (upload as needed):
  docs/research/async_await_implementation.md
  docs/research/wildx_memory_regions.md
  docs/research/generics_monomorphization_implementation.md
  docs/research/module_system_implementation.md
  docs/research/lambda_closure_implementation.md
  ... (see research_context/index.md for full list)

=====================================
UPLOAD STRATEGY
=====================================

For each research task:
1. Count required files (must be ≤10 total including specs and this guide)
2. Upload aria_specs.txt FIRST
3. Upload THIS navigation file SECOND
4. Upload recommended source parts (in order listed above)
5. Upload any additional research docs if room remains
6. Send the task description from tasks/research_XXX.txt

If you hit the 10-file limit:
- Prioritize files marked CRITICAL or LARGE in task recommendations
- Skip parser/frontend details for backend-focused tasks
- Skip codegen details for frontend-focused tasks

=====================================
TIPS FOR GEMINI
=====================================

- Parts marked [LARGE] are 60-88KB but contain essential logic
- Source files are well-commented with section headers
- Each part starts with "ARIA COMPILER SOURCE - PART X of Y"
- Look for "TODO", "FIXME", "STUB" comments for incomplete features
- Cross-reference with aria_specs.txt for requirements
