# RESEARCH TASK: Process Management Library

**Task ID:** research_005_process_management
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11
**Estimated Time:** 25-30 minutes

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Aria spec mentions process functions but **no implementation research** exists:
- `spawn(command: string, args: [string]) -> Process`
- `exec(command: string, args: [string])`

Need modern process management API covering:
- Process spawning and control
- IPC (inter-process communication)
- Environment variables
- Exit codes and signals
- Cross-platform abstractions

---

## CONTEXT

### Spec Functions
```
spawn(command: string, args: [string]) -> Process
exec(command: string, args: [string])
```

### Design Considerations
- Async process spawning
- Pipe stdin/stdout/stderr
- Process groups and sessions
- Windows vs Unix process models
- Security (argument injection prevention)

---

## DELIVERABLES

### 1. Process API Design

**Requirements:**
- Complete API for process control
- Spawn, exec, fork equivalents
- Process state management
- Signal handling

**Include:**
- Function signatures
- Usage examples
- Cross-platform considerations

### 2. IPC Mechanisms

**Requirements:**
- Pipes (stdin/stdout/stderr)
- Environment passing
- Exit code handling
- Error scenarios

**Include:**
- IPC patterns
- Buffer management
- Example parent-child communication

### 3. Cross-Platform Strategy

**Requirements:**
- Unix (fork/exec/wait)
- Windows (CreateProcess)
- Unified API abstraction

**Include:**
- Platform differences
- Abstraction approach
- Testing strategy

---

## RELEVANT SPECIFICATIONS

From aria_specs.txt:
```
Built-in Functions:
  spawn(command: string, args: [string]) -> Process
  exec(command: string, args: [string])
```

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

**Focus Areas:**
1. Safe process spawning (prevent injection)
2. Async integration
3. Modern process control patterns

**Key Questions:**
- How do Rust, Go, Node.js handle processes?
- Should we support shell vs direct execution?
- How to handle stdio pipes efficiently?
- Signal handling patterns?

**Deliverable Format:**
- API design with examples
- Platform abstraction strategy
- Comparison with existing languages

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Research complete when we can:
1. Design process management API
2. Plan cross-platform implementation
3. Define IPC patterns
4. Integrate with async system

---

**PRIORITY:** Important for systems programming use cases
