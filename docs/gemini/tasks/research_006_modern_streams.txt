# RESEARCH TASK: Modern I/O Streams Design

**Task ID:** research_006_modern_streams
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11
**Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Aria spec requires **four standard streams** (not just the traditional three):
```
stdin   - Standard input
stdout  - Standard output
stderr  - Standard error
stddbg  - Standard debug (NEW!)
stddati - Standard data in (NEW!)
stddato - Standard data out (NEW!)
```

No research exists on:
- Why these additional streams?
- How to implement them cross-platform?
- What's the use case differentiation?

---

## CONTEXT

### Traditional Model (C/Unix)
- stdin (fd 0)
- stdout (fd 1)
- stderr (fd 2)

### Aria's Extended Model
Adds three more streams for specialized purposes:
- `stddbg` - Separate debug channel
- `stddati` - Data input channel
- `stddato` - Data output channel

### Questions
- How do these map to file descriptors?
- Windows compatibility?
- Redirection and piping behavior?

---

## DELIVERABLES

### 1. Stream Purpose Analysis

**Requirements:**
- Clear use cases for each stream
- Why separate stddbg from stderr?
- What are stddati/stddato for?

**Include:**
- Usage examples
- Comparison with traditional streams
- Benefits of the extended model

### 2. Implementation Strategy

**Requirements:**
- File descriptor assignments
- Cross-platform abstraction
- Buffering strategy

**Include:**
- Unix implementation (fds 3-5?)
- Windows implementation
- TTY vs pipe behavior

### 3. API Design

**Requirements:**
- How to read/write each stream
- Integration with print functions
- Redirection support

**Include:**
- Function signatures
- Usage examples
- Error handling

## RELEVANT SPECIFICATIONS

From aria_specs.txt:
```
I/O Streams:
  stdin, stdout, stderr (traditional)
  stddbg  - Standard debug output
  stddati - Standard data input
  stddato - Standard data output
```

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

**Focus Areas:**
1. Rationale for additional streams
2. Cross-platform implementation
3. Integration with existing tools (shells, IDEs)

**Key Questions:**
- What problem do stddati/stddato solve?
- How should shells/OSes handle fd 3-5?
- Any prior art for extended stream models?
- How do other languages handle debug output?

**Deliverable Format:**
- Use case analysis
- Implementation plan
- API design examples

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Research complete when we understand:
1. Purpose of each stream
2. How to implement cross-platform
3. API design for stream access
4. Integration with tooling

**PRIORITY:** Core I/O feature, spec requirement
