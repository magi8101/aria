TMP at /home/randy/._____RANDY_____/REPOS/aria_tmp , we use this for debugging or anything else temporary

IMPORTANT!!!
- Check specs and research before every step to make sure we are building the right stuff
- Keep everything as modular as possible so we don't end up with the 6000+ line monolith codegen again that becomes to complex to make additions to or fix bugs in. 
- Go in order listed in todo.txt, commit to development branch, push to main only after extensively tested
- Make sure to document your progress so we know where we stopped when we need to take a break
- No deviation from specs, they are the source of truth in case of any ambiguity
- If you get stuck and need help debugging, please just ask for help. What we do, is empty the TMP folder mentioned above, copy all source files related to the problem to that folder, and then a detailed bug description and i will help you debug it. Remember, its okay not to know. We will work through it together.
